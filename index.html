      The California poppy exhibits a high degree of variability. Four varieties can be found in <em>E. california</em> subsp. <em>californica</em>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>E. californica subsp. californica var. californica, which is found along the coast from the San Francisco Peninsula north. They are perennial and somewhat prostrate, with yellow flowers.</li>
      <li>E. californica subsp. californica var. maritima (E. L. Greene) Jeps., which is found along the coast from Monterey south to San Miguel Island. They are perennial, long-lived, glaucous, short in stature, and have extremely prostrate growth and yellow flowers.</li>
      <li>E. californica subsp. californica var. crocea (Benth.) Jeps., which grows in non-arid inland regions. They are perennial, taller, and have orange flowers.</li>
      <li>E. California subsp. californica var. peninsularis (E. L. Greene) Munz, which is an annual or facultative annual growing in arid inland environments.</li>

    <h2>Resources</h2>
    <p>The Forest Service's website also features a "Plant of the Week" article with information on the California Poppy. I'm not seeing any semantic HTML elements, so I think this website was written in HTML 4. All of the content is in divs with unique IDs. Because you need to search within each div tag, it takes a little longer to identify areas (i.e. the footer) when you're viewing the page source.</p>
